This folder contains XSL parts needed to generate very slim CSVs 

They will only contain following data fields: 
"NETBIOS","QID","STATUS","LAST_FOUND","SEVERITY","CVE","TITLE"


To implement 
Rename the "detection2csv.xsl_part1" and "detection2csv.xsl_part2" files in the parent folder to something else. 
Try this: 
 - detection2csv.xsl_part1.orig
 - detection2csv.xsl_part2.orig

Update the names of these "part" files in this folder by removing the "_NETBIOS-ONLY" from their names.


Copy the newly renamed _NETBIOS_ONLY files into to the parent folder.



Note:  Looking at the differences between the NETBIOS and regular XSL part files should help understand how to update the XSL files to fit your needs.
