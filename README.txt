This GIT repository provides unsupported but useful scripts for use with QualysGuard's Vulnerability Management Product and API.  

It is designed to first download the QualysGuard "QID" knowledgebase, then create a light version of this database to slim down your data.

It's designed for enterprises who would like a method to download their vulnerability data to XML and CSV directly without using reports.

It uses Qualys Guard's API version 2

It downloads all OPEN Severity 1 - 5 vulnerablities in your auto vulnerability data.  They are stored in 5 XML files seperated by vulnerability severity.  Like reports, the downloads are subject to your close/ignore remediation tickets.

The script uses the light KB it generates along with the 5 XMLs to create 5 Comma Seperated Values (CSV) files also seperated by severity.


- API support is required on the account
- Knowledgebase download support is required on the account


The userID, password, API FQDN, and results output folder are all configurable.

The script is designed to operate single-threaded to avoid API concurrency problems.


NOTE:  If the CSV contains too much or too little data, you can control it by changing the data column headers along with the CVE and non-CVE sections in the detection2csv.xsl.  

Due to the need to dynamically control output paths in the script, the XSL is actually generated as follows:

detection2csv.xsl_part1 ----> detection2csv.xsl  (overwrite each time the script is ran)
[dynamic script output]---->> detection2csv.xsl  (append to this new file)
detection2csv.xsl_part2 --->> detection2csv.xsl  (append to this new file)


You'll need to change _part1 and _part2, not the .xsl itself
